			<p class="hello">	Hello! I a 15 year old teenage girl. I am currently a first year Stanford SMASH scholar. In this program I have started some type of interest for computer science. Right now I am attending San Benito high school, which is located in Hollister. In total, my family consists of 6 members. I have two incredible brothers and one little sister. I enjoy spending time with my lovable, adorable, and cute little puppy named Teddy. You can say I am fascinated by sports. My favorite sport is basketball because it is entertaining and contains lots of competitive teams. The team I cheer on are the Golden State Warriors. Right now I am play tennis in high school, but i've played baseball and basketball as well. An interesting fact about myself is that I have a scar in my eyebrow. I got it as a 2 year old when I fell down a stair step made of concrete. At least that's what my mom told me.

			<p class="hello">	Although I have a significant education, I also enjoy spending my free time in an entertaining way. My hobbies are cooking, painting, baking, playing sports, and listening to music. All of these hobbies make me forget about problems and help me relax. As for painting and drawing, I have actually won some contests. Like a year book contest and another that ended up in the newspaper in Washington. I'm pretty proud of the accumulation of successes in my life.
